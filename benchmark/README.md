# Benchmark

To run this benchmark, you need to clone this entire project.

After cloning, install the dependencies in the root of this repository:

```bash
npm me
```

Then build the library with:


```bash
npm run build
```

Now, you can use the current version of the library, so go to `benchmark` and install the dependencies again.

```bash
cd benchmark
npm me
```

Finally, run the `bench.js` script with:

```
node src/bench.js
```
